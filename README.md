## NEW: Translations

Starting V3, Spanish have two packages, one with english texts, and a second with translations (not 100% yet). You can download any of these or both.

Yes you can install both differents packages for spanish but you CAN'T use both at same time, but installing both you will able to switch quickly between English and Spanish if you need it.
